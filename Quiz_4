### Question 1:  Apply strsplit() to split all the names of the data frame on the characters "wgtp". What is the value of the 123 element of the resulting list?

fileURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2Fss06hid.csv"
download.file(fileURL, destfile = "2006 Microdata Idaho")
Idahodata <- read.csv("2006 Microdata Idaho")

## Split names of "wgtp" and finding value of 123 element

splitnames = strsplit(names(Idahodata),"wgtp")
splitnames[[123]]

### Answer 1: [1] ""   "15"

### Question 2: Remove the commas from the GDP numbers in millions of dollars and average them. What is the average?

fileURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FGDP.csv"
download.file(fileURL, destfile = "GDP Data")
GDPdata <- read.csv("GDP Data", skip = 5, nrows = 190, stringsAsFactors = F, header = F)

## Naming columns, chaning to numeric, removing commas from gdp$ and finding mean

GDPdata <- GDPdata[, c(1, 2, 4, 5)]
colnames(GDPdata) <- c("countrycode", "ranking", "countryname", "gdpvalue")
mean(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", GDPdata$gdpvalue)))

### Answer 2: [1] 377652.4

### Question 3: In the data set from Question 2 what is a regular expression that would allow you to count the number of countries whose name begins with "United"? Assume that the variable with the country names in it is named countryNames. How many countries begin with United? 

### Answer 3: grep("^United",countryNames), 3

### Question 4: Match the data based on the country shortcode. Of the countries for which the end of the fiscal year is available, how many end in June?

fileURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FGDP.csv"
download.file(fileURL, destfile = "GDP Data")

fileURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FEDSTATS_Country.csv"
download.file(fileURL, destfile = "EDU Data")

GDPdata <- read.csv("GDP Data", skip = 5, nrows = 190, stringsAsFactors = F, header = F)
EDUdata <- read.csv("EDU Data", stringsAsFactors = F)

## Find countries whose fiscal year ends in June - Fiscal year data is stored in Special.Notes

length(grep("[Ff]iscal year end(.*)+June", matchdata$Special.Notes))

### Answer 4: [1] 13

### Question 5: How many values were collected in 2012? How many values were collected on Mondays in 2012?

library(quantmod)
amzn = getSymbols("AMZN",auto.assign=FALSE)
sampleTimes = index(amzn) 
library(lubridate)

## Subset observations made in 2012 and find # and find # of mondays from 2012

year2012 <- subset(sampleTimes, year(sampleTimes) == 2012)
length(year2012)

length(which(wday(year2012, label = T) == "Mon"))

### Answer 5: [1] 250 and [1] 47
